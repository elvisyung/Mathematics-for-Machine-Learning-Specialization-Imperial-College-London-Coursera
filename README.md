# Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization

Mathematics for Machine Learning. Learn about the prerequisite mathematics for applications in data science and machine learning (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) 

In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.

The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy &  knowledge.

At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.

This specialization will prepare me for future machine learning courses. Machine learning offered by Stanford Univeristy will be my next course as I continue to learn more about machine learning (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
